# Arcaflow Plugin Catalog

> [!WARNING]
> This catalog is currently manually maintained and is not expected to be up-to-date.

Arcaflow plugins that are officially maintained by the community are in individual
repositories in the Arcalot GitHub organization. The plugin repository names should
always begin with the prefix *arcaflow-plugin-*, so the current list of plugins is
generally searchable in the repos list with [*in:name
arcaflow-plugin-*](https://github.com/orgs/arcalot/repositories?q=in%3Aname+arcaflow-plugin-).

> [!NOTE]
> There are a few supporting repositories that also begin with the *arcaflow-plugin-*
> prefix that are **not** plugins, such as [this
> repository](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-plugin-catalog) and
> [arcaflow-plugin-sdk-python](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-plugin-sdk-python).

## Plugin Containers

The [Arcaflow Container Toolkit
(ACT)](https://github.com/arcalot/arcaflow-container-toolkit) is used in GitHub CI
automations to auto-build multi-architecture plugin containers and upload them to the
public [Quay cotainer repository](https://quay.io/organization/arcalot). In general, the
`:latest` tag should point to the latest released version of the plugin container, and
the `:main_latest` tag should point to the latest container build from the main branch
of the plugin. Development builds are also auto-created by ACT, with tags that include
the development branch name and commit hash, such as `:simplify-schema_be4f338`.

## Catalog

### Maintained and Supported Plugins

These plugins are considered actively-maintained and have full CI automation to build
containers and push them to the Quay image repository. Issue reports are monitored, and
plugins are maintained for compatibility and updates of dependencies.

### Archived Plugins

These plugins have been archived, and as a result are effectively frozen at their last
development and release state at the time of archive. The plugins are not maintained,
but the released container builds should remain avalable in the Quay image repository.

> [!WARNING]
> It is not recommended to use these plugins. They remain available for reference and to
> ensure existing workflows are not broken. If you would like to see an archived plugin
> moved back into a maintained state, please open an issue on the plugin or reach out to
> the Arcalot community.
